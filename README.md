## Technical Description

The project is based on monolithic architecture. 
In the project, I try to employ Domain-driven design concepts such as aggregates, commands, events, and etc.
I try to follow SOLID principal.
I mostly use commands. MediatR is used in the controllers. Using Mediator pattern in controller is my thesis, which may be criticised by other developers.
